"""Available layer types that can be rendered on a Lonboard Map."""

# Notes:
# - When we pass a value of `None` as a default value to a trait, that value will be
#   serialized to JS as `null` and will not be passed into the GeoArrow model (see the
#   lengthy assignments of type `..(isDefined(this.param) && { param: this.param })`).
#   Then the default value in the JS GeoArrow layer (defined in
#   `@geoarrow/deck.gl-layers`) will be used.

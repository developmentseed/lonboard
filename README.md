A Python library for fast, interactive geospatial vector data visualization in Jupyter.

Building on cutting-edge technologies like [GeoArrow](https://github.com/geoarrow/geoarrow) and [GeoParquet](https://github.com/opengeospatial/geoparquet) in conjunction with [GPU-based map rendering](https://deck.gl/), Lonboard aims to enable visualizing large geospatial datasets interactively through a simple interface.

## Install

To install Lonboard using pip:

```
pip install lonboard
```

Lonboard is on [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/lonboard) and can be installed using [conda](https://docs.conda.io), [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/), or [pixi](https://pixi.sh/). To install Lonboard using conda:

```
conda install -c conda-forge lonboard
```

To install from source, refer to the [developer documentation](https://github.com/developmentseed/lonboard/blob/main/DEVELOP.md).

## Get Started

For the simplest rendering, pass geospatial data into the top-level [`viz` function](https://developmentseed.org/lonboard/latest/api/viz/#lonboard.viz.viz).

```py
import geopandas as gpd
from lonboard import viz

gdf = gpd.GeoDataFrame(...)
viz(gdf)
```

Under the hood, this delegates to a [`ScatterplotLayer`](https://developmentseed.org/lonboard/latest/api/layers/scatterplot-layer/), [`PathLayer`](https://developmentseed.org/lonboard/latest/api/layers/path-layer/), or [`SolidPolygonLayer`](https://developmentseed.org/lonboard/latest/api/layers/solid-polygon-layer/). Refer to the [documentation](https://developmentseed.org/lonboard/) and [examples](https://developmentseed.org/lonboard/latest/examples/internet-speeds/) for more control over rendering.

## Documentation

Refer to the documentation at [developmentseed.org/lonboard](https://developmentseed.org/lonboard/).

## Why the name?

This is a new binding to the [deck.gl](https://deck.gl) geospatial data visualization library. A "deck" is the part of a skateboard you ride on. What's a fast, geospatial skateboard? A <em>lon</em>board.

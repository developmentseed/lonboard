Python library for extremely fast geospatial vector data visualization in Jupyter.

<p align="center">3 million points rendered from a geopandas <code>GeoDataFrame</code> in JupyterLab.</p>

## Install

```
pip install lonboard
```

## Get Started

For the simplest rendering, pass geospatial data into the top-level [`viz` function](https://developmentseed.org/lonboard/latest/api/viz/#lonboard.viz.viz).

```py
import geopandas as gpd
from lonboard import viz

gdf = gpd.GeoDataFrame(...)
viz(gdf)
```

Under the hood, this delegates to a `ScatterplotLayer`, `PathLayer`, or `SolidPolygonLayer`. Refer to the [documentation](https://developmentseed.org/lonboard/) and [examples](https://developmentseed.org/lonboard/latest/examples/internet-speeds/) for more control over rendering.

## Documentation

Refer to the documentation at [developmentseed.org/lonboard](https://developmentseed.org/lonboard/).

## Why the name?

This is a new binding to the [deck.gl](https://deck.gl) geospatial data visualization library. A "deck" is the part of a skateboard you ride on. What's a fast, geospatial skateboard? A <em>lon</em>board.

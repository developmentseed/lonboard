# HeatmapLayer

!!! warning
    The `HeatmapLayer` is not currently working.

    As of Lonboard v0.10, Lonboard upgraded to version 9.0 of the underlying [deck.gl](https://deck.gl/) library. deck.gl [appears to have a bug](https://github.com/visgl/deck.gl/issues/8960#issuecomment-2284791644) with the HeatmapLayer in 9.0, that has not yet been fixed.

    Please temporarily downgrade to Lonboard v0.9 if you would like to use the `HeatmapLayer`.

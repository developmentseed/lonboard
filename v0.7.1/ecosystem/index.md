# Ecosystem

Lonboard aims to both integrate closely in the existing Python geospatial ecosystem and be future proof for the next generation of Python geospatial libraries.

The pages in this section outline various integrations. If there's a library you think Lonboard should integrate with or you want to document existing compatibility, [create an issue](https://github.com/developmentseed/lonboard/issues/new) to discuss.
